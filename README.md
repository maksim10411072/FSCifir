# How it works (from cifir repo)
- Header: The first line specifies the resolution of the image in the format <widthxheight>. For example, <3x3> represents an image with a width of 3 pixels and a height of 3 pixels.

- Pixel Data: Each subsequent line represents a row of pixels in the image. Each pixel is defined by a hexadecimal RGB color code prefixed with a #. For example, #ff0000 represents red, #00ff00 represents green, and #0000ff represents blue.
